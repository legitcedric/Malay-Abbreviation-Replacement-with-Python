## Welcome to Cedric's GitHub Page on a tool for replacing Malay abbreviations with standard vernacular in Python!

### Here you can find the powerpoint which explains the aims and how I managed to tweak my sample code (in Python)
Abbreviation Replacement.pptx

### And also the code itself 
Text Convertor.py

- Added the function to replace abbreviations with standard vernacular (non-exhaustive)
- The replacements can be done multiple times at once
- Added the function to automatically copy the text after the input
* Useful for converting non-standard Malay (used in social media, short-form) into standard Malay
- Limitations: the full list of abbreviations are not included in the code
